This venture, later named \\nHaven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway.[128][129]  \\nBezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by \\nBezos Expeditions.[130] Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including \\nan Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural \\nCircuit Dynamics at Princeton Neuroscience Institute.[131][132] In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the \\nrecovery of two Saturn V first-stage Rocketdyne F-1 engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[133] \\nThey were positively identified as belonging to the Apollo 11 mission's S-1C stage from July \\n1969.[134][135] The engines are currently on display at the Seattle Museum of Flight.[136][137]  \\nAltos Labs \\nMain article: Altos Labs \\nIn September 2021, Bezos co-founded Altos Labs with Mail.ru founder Yuri Milner. Altos Labs is a \\nwell-funded biotechnology company dedicated to harnessing cellular reprogramming to develop \\nlongevity therapeutics.[6] The company has recruited prominent scientists such as Juan Carlos Izpisúa \\nBelmonte (known for work on rejuvenation through reprogramming), Steve Horvath (known for work \\nin epigenetic aging clocks), and Shinya Yamanaka (the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of cellular \\nreprogramming in mammalian cells).[6] The company left stealth mode and launched on January 19, \\n2022, with a start capital of $3 billion and an executive team led by Hal Barron.[138]\"), Document(id='1d0f1b2e-9e7d-4764-b78c-b651846354bd', metadata={'author': 'SIDDESH SAKHALKAR', 'producer': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'page_label': '6', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2019', 'total_pages': 9, 'source': 'Bezos.pdf', 'creationdate': '2024-08-09T14:46:50+05:30', 'moddate': '2024-08-09T14:46:50+05:30', 'page': 5}, page_content='preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion.[97] Rob Meyerson led Blue Origin from 2003 \\nto 2017 and served as its first president.[98]  \\nAfter its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of \\nland in West Texas for a launch and test facility.[99] After the company gained the public\\'s attention \\nduring the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing the cost of space travel for \\nhumans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[100] In September 2011, one of the \\ncompany\\'s uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash \\nwas viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in \\nadvancing spaceflight.[101] After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his \"lucky\" Texas \\nCowboy boots to all rocket launches.[102] In May 2013, Bezos met with Richard Branson, chairman of \\nVirgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[103] He has been \\ncompared to Branson and Elon Musk as all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among \\ntheir business interests.[104]  \\nIn 2015, Bezos announced that a new orbital launch vehicle was under development and would \\nmake its first flight in the late-2010s.[105] Later in November, Blue Origin\\'s New Shepard space vehicle \\nsuccessfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 \\nkilometers) before executing a vertical landing back at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos \\nallowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[106] He has repeatedly called for \\nincreased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated \\nwith business-related pollution.[107]  \\nIn December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landed dummy passengers, amending and \\npushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[108] To execute this program, Blue Origin \\nbuilt six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, \\nflights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[109] Since 2016, Bezos has \\nspoken more freely about his hopes to colonize the solar system, and has been selling US$1 billion in \\nAmazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[110][111] In May \\n2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve the natural resources of \\nEarth by making the human species multi-planetary.[112] He announced that New Shepard would \\nbegin transporting humans into sub-orbital space by November 2018.[112] In July 2018, it was \\nannounced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per \\nperson.[113]  \\nSpaceflight \\nJeff Bezos \\nSpace career \\nCommercial Astronaut \\n \\nFlight time 10m 18s \\nSelection Blue Origin \\nMissions NS-16')]\n"
